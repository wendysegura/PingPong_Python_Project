# PingPong_Python_Project
First python project made at Hackbrights Part Time Class Intro to Programming.
This project utulizes Kivy and can be used alongside Kivy Launch app to play the game. This ping pong game has a sound for the paddles as well as background music.
It contains a kivy file which is used to create the background in which the game is played alongside the pong ball, and paddles as well as the scoreboard.
The python file has notes on what each class does and how it is used. I had help from my TA Aaron for this project as I had trouble gettin gthe sound to work.
There is a lot of documentation online that shows step by step to create a ping pong game in case you are interested in creating one. Happy Coding.
